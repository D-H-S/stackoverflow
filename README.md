We will, however, summarize the relevant ones for this readme here:

# Project Description

OBJECTIVE: Program a Stack Overflow-like website.

MAJOR FEATURES:
1- Asking and Answering programming questions.
2- Voting on Answers.
3- Accept the best answer.

DESCRIPTION: We as a team have to code and host a website similar to Stack Overflow. In it, users can log in, ask questions about programming, have those questions be answered by other users (logged in or not) and let users (logged in) vote on answers and questions. The user who asked the question can pick the best answer, causing their question to become “solved” and have a special status.

LANGUAGES: Php, Javascript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, possibly more

## Meetings
As this is a private repository, we do not have the capability to write a wiki - we will correct this for the first sprint, but for now I will share screenshots of the important parts of our meeting on discord:
